# 🏁 Sprint 1 Submission – Automated Consent Dashboard & Auditor

Welcome to our Sprint 1 submission for the Hushh PDA Hackathon! This document confirms our alignment with the hackathon goals and outlines our project agent: **Automated Consent Dashboard & Auditor**.

## 📦 Sprint 1 Deliverables

### ✅ 1. GitHub Repo Link

Please see our forked project repository: AI-Lovers

### ✅ 2. Agent Name

Our agent name is: 
```bash
consent_dashboard_auditor
```

The code will reside in:
```bash
hushh_mcp/agents/consent_dashboard_auditor/
```

### ✅ 3. One-Line Problem Statement

> “Aggregates and visualizes all third-party services with access to a user’s data, enabling instant consent review, revocation, and full audit logging through an intuitive dashboard.”

### ✅ 4. Consent Scope(s) to Be Used

Our agent will use:
- `vault.read.email`
- `vault.read.finance`
- `agent.identity.verify`
- `custom.audit.log`

This ensures proper access for scanning data authorizations, reviewing linked accounts, confirming user identity, and maintaining detailed consent event logs.

## 🧠 Project Value & Alignment

Our Automated Consent Dashboard & Auditor directly embodies the hackathon’s mission:
- **User control & transparency:** Users see and audit every app with access to their data.
- **Granular consent:** Instantly revoke, minimize, or alter permissions.
- **Modularity:** Each integration (email, finance, cloud) is a composable “operon.”
- **Mentor feedback:** We welcome guidance on UI, scope, and modular agent design.
